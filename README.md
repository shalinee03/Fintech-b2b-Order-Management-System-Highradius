Overview
Introduction to order management and Approval Workflow
Order Management is the core of any B2B or B2C company. Order management is
the end to end process of receiving an order, processing it and driving it to
fulfillment - based on the end goal.
Order management involves a series of interconnected touchpoints and
stakeholders who work collaboratively together. The order fulfillment system (as it is
also known) not only secures that order-to-cash (O2C) processes run smoothly, but
also gives businesses the opportunity to build customer profiles and keep track of
inventory volume and sales records.
In the real work world- Different workflows are set up for different management
activities based on certain rules and strategies. The relevant stakeholders (Eg
Manager, Director etc ) along the corporate hierarchy are given different levels of
approvals.
In the given problem statement - we will be building an order management
application that has different approval workflows.  enabling a user to add and
edit orders and get them fulfilled (i.e. approved/rejected) based on the order
amount.
The objective of the project is:
● To build an Order Management Application
● Build an Order Dashboard and a Login page.
● Add and Edit order data in the editable fields of the grid.
● Perform Searching operations in the grid.
● Build an approval workflow that allows the user to approve or reject an order
based on certain predefined rules and strategies.
